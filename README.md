# transformer-interpretability

Following [A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html), we train a mini GPT with 2 transformer blocks and attempt to observe the following behavior in the transformer heads:
* copying 
* shift-1 behavior, and 
* induction heads
* virtual heads
